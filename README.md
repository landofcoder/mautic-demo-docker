# About Mautic

Mautic is the worldâ€™s largest open source marketing automation project. With over 200,000 organisations using Mautic and over 1,000 community volunteers, we empower businesses by making it easy to manage their marketing across a range of channels. Stay up to date about initiatives, releases and strategy via our blog.

Marketing automation has historically been difficult to implement within organisations. The Mautic Community is an example of open source at its best, offering great software and a vibrant and caring community in which to learn and share knowledge.

Open source means more than open code. Open source provides equality for all and a chance for everyone to improve.
